Right and left shift : Problem 6

(x>>4)&1 

or

(x>>4)^0

So, want the boolean value of the expression to be true if 5th bit is set. Ie. if x>>4 is equal to 1. To implement using bitwise operators, either AND with 1 or XOR with 0.

I assume that if the number has more than 5 bits set. Ie. x>>4 is longer than 1 bit, the bitwise operator returns the boolean value of a comparison of the single bit 1 (or 0), and the LSB of x>>4)
